#  Case Study: Driving Operational Efficiency through Data-Driven Insights  

## 🌍 Context  
SBM Offshore, a global leader in floating production and offshore energy solutions, operates in a high-stakes environment where operational efficiency, compliance, and cost control are crucial. Managing complex datasets across engineering, operations, and finance requires robust analytics to guide business decisions, improve efficiency, and maintain governance.  

The challenge: **design a data-driven performance monitoring framework** that integrates operational, financial, and compliance data, enabling stakeholders to access accurate, timely insights for decision-making and strategic planning.  

---

## ✅ Problem  
Despite access to large volumes of data, decision-makers faced three critical challenges:  
- **Fragmented Data Sources** – Data spread across engineering, finance, and compliance systems slowed down reporting.  
- **Limited Visibility** – Reports were descriptive but lacked predictive insights for proactive decision-making.  
- **Data Governance Risks** – Inconsistent validation processes risked inaccurate reporting and compliance issues.  

---

## ✅ Solution  
Developed a **centralized business data analytics framework** focused on governance, operational performance, and cost optimization.  

### 🔹 Data Integration & Quality  
- Built ETL pipelines in **SQL** and **Python** to consolidate operational, financial, and compliance datasets.  
- Applied validation rules and cleansing logic to ensure **data integrity and audit readiness**.  

### 🔹 Advanced Analytics & Modeling  
- Designed **predictive models** to identify anomalies in asset performance and forecast cost overruns.  
- Applied **regression and clustering** to uncover downtime patterns and budget deviations.  

### 🔹 Dashboards & Reporting  
- Built interactive dashboards in **Tableau** and **Power BI** with:  
  - Operational KPIs (uptime %, failure frequency, maintenance backlog)  
  - Financial KPIs (budget vs actuals, variance trends)  
  - Compliance KPIs (governance scorecards, control checks)  
- Translated technical insights into **clear business narratives** for senior management.  

### 🔹 Business Partnering & Change Enablement  
- Collaborated with engineering, operations, and finance teams to align metrics with business objectives.  
- Conducted **training sessions** to foster a **data-driven culture** and tool adoption.  

---

## ✅ Results & Impact  
-  **30% faster reporting cycles** – Automated ETL pipelines enabled near real-time insights.  
-  **20% improvement in data accuracy** – Governance controls reduced discrepancies.  
-  **$5M in cost savings identified** – Predictive analytics flagged early project overruns.  
-  **12% reduction in downtime** – Optimized maintenance schedules through data insights.  
-  **Culture shift** – Business units embraced a **data-first approach** to operations.
